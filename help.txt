Welcome to sloc cpp, version 1.0, (c) DIMAp/UFRN.

NAME
  sloc - single line of code counter.

SYNOPSIS
  sloc [-h | --help] [-r] [(-s | -S) f|t|c|b|s|a] <file | directory>

EXAMPLES
  sloc main.cpp sloc.cpp
     Counts loc, comments, blanks of the source files 'main.cpp' and 'sloc.cpp'

  sloc source
     Counts loc, comments, blanks of all C/C++ source files inside 'source'

  sloc -r -s c source
     Counts loc, comments, blanks of all C/C++ source files recursively inside 'source'
     and sort the result in ascending order by # of comment lines.

DESCRIPTION
  Sloc counts the individual number **lines of code** (LOC), comments, and blank
  lines found in a list of files or directories passed as the last argument
  (after options).
  After the counting process is concluded the program prints out to the standard
  output a table summarizing the information gathered, by each source file and/or
  directory provided.
  It is possible to inform which fields sloc should use to sort the data by, as
  well as if the data should be presented in ascending/descending numeric order.

OPTIONS:
  -h/--help
            Display this information.

  -r
            Look for files recursively in the directory provided.

  -s f|t|c|b|s|a
            Sort table in ASCENDING order by (f)ilename, (t) filetype,
            (c)omments, (b)lank lines, (s)loc, or (a)ll. Default is to show
            files in ordem of appearance.

  -S f|t|c|b|s|a
            Sort table in DESCENDING order by (f)ilename, (t) filetype,
            (c)omments, (b)lank lines, (s)loc, or (a)ll. Default is to show
            files in ordem of appearance.
